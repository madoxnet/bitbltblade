= Loightscythe =

The loightscythe is a device for generating images superimposed on 
backgrounds using long exposure photography.  The concept is based on 
Gavin Smith's lightscythe :

The name is intended to be distinct, yet related.  A google search for
loightscythe should also point to Gavin's webpage instead of mine.
See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norfolk_dialect] for the origin of 
"loight".
